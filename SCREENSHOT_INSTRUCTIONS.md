# Screenshot Instructions

To properly display the screenshots in the README.md, please follow these steps:

1. Save each of the screenshots shown in our conversation to your local machine.

2. Name the files as follows and save them to the `assets/images/screenshots` directory:
   - The recording playback screen with transcription: `recording-transcription.png`
   - The "Share Your Story" recording screen: `share-story.png`
   - The recording in progress screen: `recording-progress.png`
   - The "Well done!" completion screen with shield: `completion-shield.png`
   - The "Bewertung" feedback form: `feedback-form.png`
   - The support needs survey screen: `support-survey.png`

3. Once you've saved all the screenshots to the correct location, proceed with committing the changes:

```bash
# Add the new files to git
git add assets/images/screenshots/*.png
git add README.md
git add SCREENSHOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add application screenshots to README"

# Push to GitHub
git push
